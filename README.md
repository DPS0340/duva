## Duva
This project is aimed at distributed cache server using Actor models, designed for efficient and scalable key-value store operations.

### Features
The following features have been implemented so far:

- Core Commands
    - SET: Store a key-value pair.
        - Expiration: Set a time-to-live (TTL) for keys.
    - GET: Retrieve the value associated with a key.
    - KEYS (with pattern matching): Retrieve keys matching specific patterns.

- Advanced Features
    - Auto Deletion: Automatically remove expired keys.
    - Local Sharding: Efficiently manage data distribution across local actors.
    - Configuration Settings: Customize server behavior with adjustable configurations.
    - Persistence: Dump data into an rdb file (similar to Redisâ€™ dump.rdb).

- Protocol Support
    - RESP Protocol: Fully implemented for parsing client requests, ensuring compatibility with Redis-like commands.

### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable version)



Build the project:

```sh
cargo run
```

If you have dump file, and load up on start up,
```sh
cargo run -- --dir directory-path --dbfilename filename
```



### Protocol
This server supports the RESP Protocol, enabling interaction with clients in a familiar Redis-like manner.

### Roadmap
Future enhancements may include:

- Distributed sharding
- Replication
    - Anti-entropy mechanism (dotted version vector)
    - Dissemination (TBD)
- Pub/Sub support
- More advanced data types (e.g., lists, sets, hashes)
- Write-through / read-through support
